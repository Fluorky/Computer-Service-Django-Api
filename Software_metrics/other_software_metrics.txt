In summary, the design (class diagram) appears to be well organized and follows good programming practices.
Classes are organized hierarchically, and methods and attributes are logically placed in their respective classes.
This diagram is relatively flat, which can make it easier to understand the structure of the project.
Methods and attributes are logically placed in the corresponding classes, and the inheritance structure is not too complicated.
The WMC and DIT values are low, suggesting that the classes are relatively simple and not too complex.
